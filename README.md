Custom Teleop Twist Keyboard is a user-friendly ROS 2 package designed to make robot control simple, smooth, and fun — just like playing a game.
This customized version of the standard teleop_twist_keyboard provides intuitive key mappings for easy robot movement in all directions, including forward, backward, sideways, and diagonal motions.

It also adds:

Extra movement controls for flexible robot navigation

Emergency stop (space key) for safety during operation

Game-like key layout for a more natural and engaging teleoperation experience

You can easily modify or extend the key mappings by editing only the main Python script inside the package to suit your specific robot or application.
